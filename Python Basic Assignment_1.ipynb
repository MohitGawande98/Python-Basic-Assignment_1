    "            by that we are going to describe 3 different data types.\n",
    " 1)Integer:- The int datatype  represent integer number without any decimal point or a fraction part. in python it is possible to store very large integer number as there is no limit for the size of an int datatype.\n",
    "      eg. 20,10,-50,-1002\n",
    "\n",
    " 2) Float:- The float data type represents floating point numbers. the floating point number is a number that contains a decimal point.\n",
    "     eg. 25.56,10.5,-45.69,-0.8\n",
    "\n",
    " 3) Bool Type:- The bool type datatype represents boolean value True or False. python internally represents True as 1 and false as 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:- Expressions are representations of value. They are different from statement in the fact that statements do something while expressions are representations of value. for example any string is also an expressions since it represents the value of the string as well.\n",
    "            expressions is made up of identifiers, literals, and operators.\n",
    "   1)Identifiers:- Any name that is used to define a class, function, variable module, or object is an identifier.\n",
    "   2)Literals:- These are language independent terms in python and should exist independently in any programming language. In python, there are the string literals, byte literals, integer literals, floating point literals, and imaginary literals.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:- A statement is a complete line of code that performs some action, while an expression is any section of the code that evaluates to a value. Expressions can be combined horizontally into larger expressions using operators, while statements can only be combined \"vertically\" by writing one after another, or with block constructs. every expression can be used as statement but most statements can not be used as expressions."
